## 3. ABNORMAL OPERATION SEQUENCES

### 3.1 Equipment Failure Response

#### 3.1.1 LEAD Unit Failure (CRAC1)
1. **Detection**: Unit status = OFF for >15 seconds
2. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Promote LAG unit (CRAC2) to LEAD role
   - Stage STANDBY unit (CRAC3) as new LAG
   - Generate HIGH priority "CRAC_FAIL" alarm
   - Maintain temperature control with reduced capacity

3. **Performance Expectations**:
   - Maintain temperature control during failure event
   - Automatic recovery without operator intervention (demonstrated <15s)
   - Continuous temperature logging for analysis

#### 3.1.2 LAG Unit Failure (CRAC2)
1. **Detection**: Unit commanded ON but status = OFF for >15 seconds
2. **Actions**:
   - Stage STANDBY unit (CRAC3) as LAG
   - Generate MEDIUM priority "LAG_FAIL" alarm
   - Continue normal operation with LEAD + new LAG

#### 3.1.3 STANDBY Unit Failure (CRAC3)
1. **Detection**: Unit fails readiness check or alarm condition
2. **Actions**:
   - Generate LOW priority "STANDBY_FAIL" alarm
   - Continue normal operation with LEAD + LAG
   - Schedule immediate maintenance notification

### 3.2 Temperature Excursion Response

#### 3.2.1 High Temperature Alarm (>23.0°C)
